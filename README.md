# xim
xim is an experimental text editor in a 'vim' like flavour using the xi-editor backend.
This project is based heavily on [xi-term](https://github.com/xi-frontend/xi-term)

## Goals
 * Keep it simple
 * Modal vim like behaviour
    * command mode
        * ~~'w' write~~
        * '~~q' quit~~
        * 'wq' write and quit
    * search/replace mode
        * search
        * replace
 * Syntax highlighting
 * LSP at some point
